## Introduction to Quantum Computing

### A brief history

Quantum Mechanics as a branch of physics began with a set of scientific
discoveries in the late $19$th Century and has been in active
development ever since. Most people will point to the 1980s as the start
of physicists actively looking at computing with quantum systems[^1]:

-   **1982:** History of quantum computing starts with Richard Feynman
    lectures on the potential advantages of computing with quantum
    systems.

-   **1985:** David Deutsch publishes the idea of a "universal quantum
    computer".

-   **1994:** Peter Shor presents an algorithm that can efficiently find
    the factors of large numbers, significantly outperforming the best
    classical algorithm and theoretically putting the underpinning of
    modern encryption at risk (referred to now as Shor's algorithm).

-   **1996:** Lov Grover presents an algorithm for quantum computers
    that would be more efficient for searching databases (referred to
    now as Grove's search algorithm).

-   **1996:** Seth Lloyd proposes a quantum algorithm which can simulate
    quantum-mechanical systems.

-   **1999:** D-Wave Systems founded by Geordie Rose.

-   **2000:** Eddie Farhi at MIT develops idea for adiabatic quantum
    computing.

-   **2001:** IBM and Stanford University publish the first
    implementation of Shor's algorithm, factoring 15 into its prime
    factors on a 7-qubit processor.

-   **2010:** D-Wave One: first commercial quantum computer released
    (annealer).

-   **2016:** IBM makes quantum computing available on IBM Cloud.

-   **2019:** Google claims the achievement of quantum supremacy.
    Quantum Supremacy was termed by John Preskill in 2012 to describe
    when quantum systems could perform tasks surpassing those in the
    classical world.

A more complete history comes from the quantumpedia[^2], where the
development of quantum computing is divided into five distinct periods Figure [1.1](#fig:history):

### Prof. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao's Talk in Micius Salon

Prof. Yao gave a talk entitled "The Advent of Quantum Computing" in
Micius Salon in 2018[^3]. Here are some key points:

-   Two key topics: (1) what is the nature of quantum computer?; and (2)
    where does quantum computer gets its power from?

-   The particle-wave duality plays the starting role in making it
    possible for us to do quantum computing faster than classic
    computing under certain circumstances

-   Richard Feynman's question: can quantum physics be simulated
    efficiently? Answer: unlikely by a classic computer, but hopefully
    by a quantum computer.

-   The comparison of classic computer and quantum computers (Figure
    [1.2](#fig:classic-quantum)). Classic computers manipulate
    classic bits $0110\cdots$ with Boolean operations in $\{0,1\}^n$,
    while quantum computers manipulate quantum bits $\ket{0101\cdots}$ 
    with "rotations" in $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$

-   The parallel superposition is brought by the fact that each quantum
    bit represents not a single state, but a "probabilistic
    distribution" of state. Parallelism could speed up computational
    tasks.

-   quantum parallelism is only a metaphor, subtle and restricted, not
    equivalent to a parallel computer with many processors.

## Complex Numbers

The original motivation for the introduction of complex numbers was
seeking solutions of polynomial equations. Here is the simplest example:
$$x^2+1=0$$ Obviously, we cannot find its solution in the set of real
numbers. To solve this problem, Mathematics introduces following
definitions.

### Definitions

:::note[definition]
An **imaginary number** is a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit
$i$, which is defined by its property $i^2 = âˆ’1$ or $i=\sqrt{-1}$.
:::

:::note[definition]
A **complex number** is a
hybrid entity which adds a real number with an imaginary number, for
instance, $$c=a+b\times i=a+bi$$ where $a$, $b$ are two real numbers,
$a$ is called the real part of $c$, whereas $b$ is its imaginary part.
The set of all complex numbers will be denoted as $\mathbb{C}$. When the
$\times$ is understood, we shall omit it.
::: 

:::info[proposition]
Every polynomial equation of one variable with complex coefficients has
a complex solution.
:::

### The Algebra of Complex Numbers

:::note[definition]
**Ordered pair representation** defines a complex number as an ordered pair
of reals: $$c=a+b\mapsto (a, b)$$
:::

Hence, ordinary real numbers can be identified with pairs $(a, 0)$
$$a\mapsto (a, b)$$ whereas imaginary numbers can be identified with
pairs $(0, b)$. In particular, $$i\mapsto (0, 1)$$

The four **arithmetic operations** between two complex numbers can be
expressed as:

-   Addition: $$c_1+c_2=(a_1, b_1)+(a_2, b_2) = (a_1+a_2, b_1+b_2)$$

-   Subtraction: $$c_1-c_2=(a_1, b_1)-(a_2, b_2) = (a_1-a_2, b_1-b_2)$$

-   Multiplication:
    $$c_1\times c_2=(a_1, b_1)\times (a_2, b_2) = (a_1a_2-b_1b_2, a_1b_2+a_2b_1)$$

-   <div id="subdivision">Subdivision: $$\frac{c_1}{c_2}=\frac{(a_1, b_1)}{(a_2, b_2)}=(\frac{a_1a_2+b_1b_2}{a_2^2+b_2^2}, \frac{a_2b_1-a_1b_2}{a_2^2+b_2^2})$$</div>

With the addition and multiplication operations, we can re-write a
complex number as
$$c = a+bi = (a, b) = (a, 0) + (0, b) = (a, 0) + (b, 0)\times (0, 1)$$
and from the denominator in the quotient formula in
[Subdivision](#div:subdivision), we can define the **modulus** of a complex
number as: $$|c|=|a+bi|=+\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$ which has two useful
properties:

-   Property 1: $\forall c_1, c_2\in\mathbb{C}, |c_1||c_2|=|c_1c_2|$.

-   Property 2:
    $\forall c_1, c_2\in\mathbb{C}, |c_1+c_2|\leq|c_1|+|c_2|$.

where the second property is also called triangular inequality of
modulus operation.

Based on the above basic operations, it is easy to verify that complex
numbers have the following **algebraic properties**:

-   Addition has an identity called **additive identity**: $(0, 0)$,
    such that $$\forall c\in\mathbb{C}, c+(0, 0)=c$$

-   Multiplication has an identity called **multiplicative identity**:
    $(1, 0)$, such that
    $$\forall c\in\mathbb{C}, c\times(1, 0)=(1, 0)\times c=c$$

-   Both addition and multiplication are commutative: $$\left\{
            \begin{aligned}
                c_1+c_2&=c_2+c_1\\
                c_1\times c_2&=c_2\times c_1
            \end{aligned}
            \right.$$

-   Both addition and multiplication are associative: $$\left\{
            \begin{aligned}
                (c_1+c_2)+c_3&=c_1+(c_2+c_3)\\
                (c_1\times c_2)\times c_3&=c_1\times (c_2\times c_3)
            \end{aligned}
            \right.$$

-   Multiplication distributes with respect to addition:
    $$c_1\times(c_2+c_3)=c_1\times c_2+c_1\times c_3$$

-   Subtraction is defined everywhere.

-   Division is defined everywhere except when the divisor is zero.

Besides basic arithmetic operations and modulus operation, complex
numbers have a unique operation called **conjugation**. If $c=a+bi$ is
an arbitrary complex number, then the conjugate of $c$ is
$\overline{c}=a-bi$. Two numbers related by conjugation are said to be
**complex conjugates** of each other. The conjugation operation has
several basic properties:

-   Property 1: Conjugate respects addition
    $\overline{c_1+c_2}=\overline{c_1}+\overline{c_2}$.

-   Property 2: Conjugate respects multiplication
    $\overline{c_1\times c_2}=\overline{c_1}\times \overline{c_2}$.

-   Property 3: Conjugate $c\mapsto \overline{c}$ is bijective.

-   Property 4: The modulus squared of a complex number is obtained by
    multiplying the number with its conjugate
    $c\times \overline{c}=|c|^2$.

### The Geometry of Complex Numbers

:::note[definition]
The **complex plane** is the plane formed by the complex numbers, with a
Cartesian coordinate system such that the horizontal x-axis, called the
real axis, is formed by the real numbers, and the vertical y-axis,
called the imaginary axis, is formed by the imaginary numbers.
:::

In the complex plane (Figure
[fig:complex-plane](#fig:complex-plane)), we can easily find that the modulus is
nothing more than the length of the vector. Indeed, the length of a
vector, via Pythagoras' theorem, is the square root of the sum of the
squares of its edges, which is precisely the modulus, as defined in the
previous section.

Next comes addition: vectors can be added using the so-called
**parallelogram rule** illustrated by Figure
[parallelogram-rule-addition](#fig:parallelogram-rule-addition). In words, draw the
parallelogram whose parallel edges are the two vectors to be added;
their sum is the diagonal.

    style={{ width: '35%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
<figcaption style= {{textAlign: 'center', fontFamily: 'Calibri'}}>The parallelogram rule addition </figcaption>

Subtraction too has a clear geometric meaning: subtracting $c_2$ from
$c_1$ is the same as adding the negation of $c_2$, i.e., $-c_2$, to
$c_1$ (Figure
[parallelogram-rule-subtraction](#fig:parallelogram-rule-subtraction)).

To give a simple geometrical meaning to multiplication, we need to
develop yet another characterization of complex numbers.

:::note[definition]
The **polar coordinate system** is a two-dimensional coordinate system in
which each point on a plane is determined by a distance $\rho$ from a
reference point and an angle $\theta$ from a reference direction.
:::

Similar to the previous **Cartesian representation** $(a, b)$, the
**polar representation** $(\rho, \theta)$ is capable to uniquely
determine a complex number because these two representations can be
mutually converted:

:::tip[representation 1]
2 $$(a, b)\mapsto (\rho, \theta)$$ where $\rho$ is the modulus
$$\rho=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$ and $\theta$ is also easy, via trigonometry
$$\theta=\tan^{-1}\Bigg(\frac{b}{a}\Bigg)$$
:::

:::tip[representation 2]
$$(\rho, \theta)\mapsto (a, b)$$ where $a$ is the real part
$$a = \rho\cos(\theta)$$ and $b$ is the imaginary part
$$b = \rho\sin(\theta)$$
:::

In physics and engineering, angle $\theta$ is also known as **phase**
and distance $\rho$ is also known as **magnitude**. Hence, we have
another definition of a complex number

:::note[definition]
A complex number is a magnitude and a phase.
:::

We are now ready for multiplication: given two complex numbers in polar
coordinates, $c_1=(\rho_1, \theta_1)$ and $c_2=(\rho_2, \theta_2)$,
their product can be obtained by simply multiplying their magnitude and
adding their phase:
$$c_1\times c_2=(\rho_1, \theta_1)\times (\rho_2, \theta_2)=(\rho_1\rho_2, \theta_1+\theta_2)$$

Now that we are armed with a geometric way of looking at multiplication,
we can tackle division as well. After all, division is nothing more than
the inverse operation of multiplication:
$$\frac{c_1}{c_2}=\Bigg(\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2}, \theta_1-\theta_2\Bigg)$$

On this basis, we can further derive fast $n$-order power and root
calculations about a complex number $c=(\rho, \theta)$
$$c^n=(\rho^n, n\theta)$$ and
$$c^{\frac{1}{n}}=\Bigg(\rho^{\frac{1}{n}}, \frac{1}{n}(n+k2\pi)\Bigg),\ \textrm{where}\ k=0,1,\cdots,n-1$$

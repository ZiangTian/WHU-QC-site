# Quantum Cryptography



**Cryptography** is the art of concealing message. The standard
cryptography model is shown in Figure
[6.1](#fig:cryptography model).

The whole procedure can be divided into two parts:

-   Encoder (ENC) is responsible for encoding the input plaintext into
    ciphertext, which can be formulated as $\textrm{ENC}(T,K_{E})=E$
    where $T$ is the plaintext, $K_E$ is encryption key, and $E$ is the
    ciphertext.

-   Decoder (DEC) is responsible for decoding the received ciphertext
    into plaintext, which can be formulated as $\textrm{DEC}(E, K_D)=T$
    where $K_D$ is the decryption key.

$\textrm{DEC}(\textrm{ENC}(T, K_E), K_D)=T$ means that as long as we use
the right keys, we can always retrieve the original message intact
without any loss of information.

## Classic Cryptography

### Caesar cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher[^1] , also known as Caesar's cipher, the
shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and
most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution
cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter
some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. As shown in Figure
[6.2](#fig:caesar-cipher), with a left shift of 3, D would be
replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after
Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

The essence of Caesar cipher is a simple linear mapping, which has high
statistical correlation between the letter in plaintext and that in the
ciphertext. This means that by graphing the frequencies of letters in
the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those
letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily
spot the value of the shift by looking at the displacement of particular
features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. As shown in
Figure
[6.2](#fig:caesar-cipher), in the English language the
plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and
Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive.

### One-Time-Pad protocol

In cryptography, the one-time-pad (OTP) protocol[^2] is an encryption
technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a single-use
pre-shared key that is not smaller than the message being sent. In this
technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred
to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is
encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from
the pad using modular addition.


In OTP protocol, both encryption and decryption end share the same key
$K$ in the communication process, which means $K_E=K_D=K$. As shown in
Figure [6.3](#fig:otp), assume
that both encoder and decoder share the same working function
$\textrm{ENC}(T,K)=\textrm{DEC}(T,K)=T\oplus K$, than the receiver can
decode the ciphertext and get the original message as follows $$\begin{aligned}
        \textrm{DEC}(\textrm{ENC}(T,K_E),K_D)&=\textrm{DEC}(T\oplus K, K)\\
        &=(T\oplus K)\oplus K\\
        &=T\oplus (K\oplus K)\\
        &=T     
\end{aligned}$$

<figcaption style= {{textAlign: 'center', fontFamily: 'Calibri'}}>Figure 6.3: The one-time-pad protocol. </figcaption>

The merit of OTP protocol is that it cannot be cracked, but meanwhile,
it has two obvious drawbacks. First, the key in OTP must be longer than
the message being sent, which is extremely inconvenient in the
transmission and storage process; Second, the key cannot be re-used
because of the risk of information leakage[^3].

### Diffie-Hellman key exchange

To eliminate risks in the key distribution process, Whitfield Diffie and
Martin Hellman devised the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method to
securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel.

<img
    id="fig:DH"
    src={require('../static/img/DH-key-exchange.png').default}
    alt="DH"
    style={{ width: '90%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
<figcaption style= {{textAlign: 'center', fontFamily: 'Calibri'}}>Figure 6.4: Illustrative and numerical examples of Diffie-Hellman key exchange.</figcaption>

An analogy illustrates the concept of public key exchange by using
colors instead of very large numbers. As shown in Figure
[6.4](#fig:DH), the Diffie-Hellman key exchange process
begins by having the two parties, Alice and Bob, publicly agree on an
arbitrary starting color that does not need to be kept secret. In this
example, the color is yellow. Each person also selects a secret color
that they keep to themselves -- in this case, red and cyan. The crucial
part of the process is that Alice and Bob each mix their own secret
color together with their mutually shared color, resulting in orange-tan
and light-blue mixtures respectively, and then publicly exchange the two
mixed colors. Finally, each of them mixes the color they received from
the partner with their own private color. The result is a final color
mixture (yellow-brown in this case) that is identical to their partner's
final color mixture.

The numerical example of the above colorization process is shown in
Figure [6.4](#fig:DH). The pigment mixing process is formulated
as a classic trapdoor function, also dubbed as one-way function, *i.e.,*
modular exponentiation $f(x)=g^x mod p$. The forward computation, from
$x$ to $f(x)$, is easy and fast, while the backward computation, from
$f(x)$ to $x$, is extremely hard and computationally prohibitive. In the
table, $a$ and $b$ represent the secret color that Alice and Bob keep to
themselves at the beginning, $A$ and $B$ represent the publicly
exchanged color, and $s$ is the final shared color mixture. Thanks to
the one-way property of the modular exponentiation, even Eve got $A$ and
$B$, he cannot recover $a$ and $b$, not to mention the exchanged key
$s$.

### Public- and private-key cryptography

According to the availability of the encryption key, cryptography
algorithm can be divided into private-key cryptography and public-key
cryptography (Figure
[6.5](#fig:public-private-key-cryptography)).

<p float="middle">
<img
    id="fig:public-private-key-cryptography"
    src={require('../static/img/private-key-cryptography.jpg').default}
    alt="DH"
    style={{ width: '40%', height: 'auto', display: '', margin: '0 auto' }}

    style={{ width: '40%', height: 'auto', display: '', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
</p>
<figcaption style= {{textAlign: 'center', fontFamily: 'Calibri'}}>Figure 6.5: Diagrams of private-key cryptography and public-key
cryptography.</figcaption>

**private-key cryptography**, or symmetric cryptography, uses the same
cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the
decryption of ciphertext. The keys, in practice, represent a shared
secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a
private information link (Figure
[6.5](#fig:public-private-key-cryptography)). The requirement that both
parties have access to the secret key is one of the main drawbacks of
symmetric-key encryption, in comparison to public-key encryption. OTP
protocal is a typical private-key algorithm.

**Public-key cryptography**, or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of
cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys. Each key pair
consists of a public key and a corresponding private key. Key pairs are
generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems
termed one-way functions. In a public-key encryption system, anyone with
a public key can encrypt a message, yielding a ciphertext, but only
those who know the corresponding private key can decrypt the ciphertext
to obtain the original message (Figure
[6.5](#fig:public-private-key-cryptography)). Diffie-Hellman key
exchange belongs to the public-key cryptography.

The plus side of public-key cryptography is that it does have key
distribution problem. In contrast, the minus sides include: (1) the
one-way property of trapdoor function is a temporary fact that may
disappear in the future; (2) public-key cryptography is usually slower
than private-key cryptography.

Typical issues in classic cryptography include: (1) success
communication; (2) intrusion detection, *i.e.*, Alice and Bob would like
to determine whether Eve is, in fact, eavesdropping; (3) authentication,
*i.e.*, we would like to ensure that nobody is impersonating Alice and
sending false messages.

## Quantum Key Exchange

Due to the peculiar effect of quantum observation and measurement,
eavesdropping in the classical world has a very different manifestation
from that in the quantum world. Specifically, in the classic world, Eve
can make copies of arbitrary portions of the encrypted bit stream, and
he can listen without affecting the bit stream. While in the quantum
world, Eve cannot make perfect copies of the qubit stream because of the
no-cloning theorem, and the very act of measuring the qubit stream
alters it.

### The BB84 protocol

The first quantum key exchange protocol was introduced by Charles
Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984, and hence the name BB84.

**Problem setting.** Alice's goal is to send Bob a key via a quantum
channel. Just as in the One-TimePad protocol, her key is a sequence of
random (classical) bits obtained, perhaps, by tossing a coin. Alice will
send a qubit each time she generates a new bit of her key. But which
qubit should she send?

**Plus and times bases.** In this protocol, Alice will employ two
different orthogonal bases shown in Figure
[6.6](#fig:plus-times-basis). The left part shows the "plus" basis
whose formulation is

$$ + = \{\ket{\rightarrow}, \ket{\uparrow} \} = \{ [1,0]^{\top},[0,1]^{\top} \}  $$

and the right part shows the "times" basis whose formulation is 

$$ \times = \{\ket{\nwarrow}, \ket{\nearrow} \} = \{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[-1,1]^{\top},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[1,1]^{\top} \}  $$

<p float="middle">
<img
    id="fig:plus-times-basis"
    src={require('../static/img/plus-basis.png').default}
    alt="plus-times-basis"
    style={{ width: '30%', height: 'auto', display: '', margin: '0 auto' }}

<img
    id="fig:times-times-basis"
    src={require('../static/img/times-basis.jpg').default}
    alt="times-times-basis"
    style={{ width: '30%', height: 'auto', display: '', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
</p>
<figcaption style= {{textAlign: 'center', fontFamily: 'Calibri'}}>Figure 6.6: Two basis used in BB84.</figcaption>

**Cross representation.** The base vector in one basis can be linearly
represented by base vectors in another basis:

-   $\ket{\nwarrow}$ with respect to $+$ will be
    $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\uparrow}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\rightarrow}$.

-   $\ket{\nearrow}$ with respect to $+$ will be
    $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\uparrow}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\rightarrow}$.

-   $\ket{\uparrow}$ with respect to $\times$ will be
    $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\nearrow}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\nwarrow}$.

-   $\ket{\rightarrow}$ with respect to $\times$ will be
    $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\nearrow}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\nwarrow}$.

**Mapping table.** Alice translates her classic key bits into qubits
according to a mapping vocabulary shown in the following table.

<p float="middle">
|  State/Basis    |  $+$      |   $\times$   |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|   $\ket{0}$   |  $\ket{\rightarrow}$    |   $\ket{\nearrow}$   |
|   $\ket{1}$   |  $\ket{\uparrow}$     |   $\ket{\nwarrow}$   |

</p>


For example, in the $+$ basis, a $\ket{\rightarrow}$ will correspond to
a $\ket{0}$. If Alice wants to work in the $\times$ basis and wants to
convey a $\ket{1}$, she will send a $\ket{\nwarrow}$. Similarly, if
Alice sends a $\ket{\uparrow}$ and Bob measures a $\ket{\uparrow}$ in
the $+$ basis, he should record a $\ket{1}$.

**BB84 protocol.** There are totally $4$ steps in the BB84 protocol:

1.  (Alice)

    -   randomly determine classical bits to send

    -   randomly determine the bases to send bits

    -   send the bits in their appropriate basis

<img
    id="fig:BB84-step1"
    src={require('../static/img/BB84-step1.jpg').default}
    alt="BB84-step1"
    style={{ width: '60%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>


2.  (Bob)

    -   randomly determine the bases to receive bits

    -   measure the qubit in those random bases

    <img
    id="fig:BB84-step2"
    src={require('../static/img/BB84-step2.jpg').default}
    alt="BB84-step2"
    style={{ width: '60%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    />

    When there is no eavesdropping, Bob has $100\%$ probability to get
    the correct bit with consistent bases, and $50\%$ probability to get
    the correct bit with inconsistent bases. Hence the expected correct
    rate (ECR) for Bob getting the correct bit is
    $\frac{1}{2}\times 1+\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}=75\%$.

    When there is Eve bugging in, he reads the information that Alice
    transmits, and meanwhile, sneds that information onward to Bob. In
    this case, ECR changes into
    $\frac{3}{4}\times \frac{3}{4}+\frac{1}{4}(\frac{1}{2}\times 0+\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2})=62.5\%$.
    The first term means both Eve and Bob get the correct bit, while the
    second term represents that Eve gets the wrong bit but Bob gets the
    right one.

    The following Table gives another solution to calculate the ECR with
    eavesdropping, where the first stage considers the operations of
    receiving basis and sending qubit of Eve, and the second stage
    considers the receiving basis and bit of Bob.

    <img
    src={require('../static/img/tab1.png').default}
    alt="BB84-step2"
    style={{ width: '80%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    />

3.  (Alice and Bob)

    -   publicly compare which basis they used at each step

    -   scratch out corresponding bits under different bases

    <img
    id="fig:BB84-step3"
    src={require('../static/img/BB84-step3.jpg').default}
    alt="BB84-step3"
    style={{ width: '60%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    />

4.  (Bob)

    -   randomly chooses half of the $n/2$ bits

    -   publicly compares them with Alice

    <img
    id="fig:BB84-step4"
    src={require('../static/img/BB84-step4.jpg').default}
    alt="BB84-step4"
    style={{ width: '60%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    />

        If $\textrm{ECR}\leq 1-\epsilon$, Eve is listening, Alice and
        Bob scratch the whole sequence. Otherwise, Alice and Bob scratch
        out the revealed test subsequence and keep the remains as
        unrevealed secret private key.

### The B92 protocol

In the BB84 protocol, Alice had two distinct orthogonal bases at her
disposal. It turns out that the use of two different bases is redundant,
provided one employs a slightly slicker means of measuring. This
simplification results in another quantum key distribution protocol,
known as B92, invented by Charles Bennett in 1992.

**The non-orthogonal basis.** Alice uses only one non-orthogonal basis

$$ \{\ket{\rightarrow}, \ket{\nearrow} \} = \{ [1,0]^{\top},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}[1,1]^{\top} \} $$


**B92 protocol.** There are totally $4$ steps in the B92 protocol:

1.  (Alice)

    -   randomly determine classical bits to send

    -   send the bits in the appropriate polarization

    <img
    id="fig:B92-step1"
    src={require('../static/img/B92-step1.jpg').default}
    alt="B92-step1"
    style={{ width: '60%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    />

2.  (Bob)

    -   randomly determine the bases to receive bits

    -   measure the qubit in those random bases

    <img
    id="fig:B92-step2"
    src={require('../static/img/B92-step2.jpg').default}
    alt="B92-step2"
    style={{ width: '60%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    />

        -   If Bob uses the $+$ basis and observes a $\ket{\uparrow}$,
            then he knows that Alice must have sent a
            $\ket{\nearrow}=\ket{1}$ because if Alice had sent a
            $\ket{\rightarrow}$, Bob would have received a
            $\ket{\rightarrow}$.

        -   If Bob uses the $+$ basis and observes a
            $\ket{\rightarrow}$, then it is not clear to him which qubit
            Alice sent. She could have sent a $\ket{\rightarrow}$ but
            she could also have sent a $\ket{\nearrow}$ that collapsed
            to a $\ket{\rightarrow}$. Because Bob is in doubt, he will
            omit this bit.

        -   If Bob uses the $\times$ basis and observes a
            $\ket{\nwarrow}$, then he knows that Alice must have sent a
            $\ket{\rightarrow}=\ket{0}$ because if Alice had sent a
            $\ket{\nearrow}$, Bob would have received a
            $\ket{\nearrow}$.

        -   If Bob uses the $\times$ basis and observes a
            $\ket{\nearrow}$, then it is not clear to him which qubit
            Alice sent. She could have sent a $\ket{\nearrow}$ but she
            could also have sent a $\ket{\rightarrow}$ that collapsed to
            a $\ket{\nearrow}$. Because Bob is in doubt, he will omit
            this bit.

3.  (Alice and Bob)

    -   Bob publicly tells Alice which bits were uncertain

    -   they both omit uncertain bits

4.  (optional for intrusion detection)

    -   Bob randomly chooses half of the $n/2$ bits

    -   Bob publicly compares them with Alice

### The EPR protocol

In 1991, Artur K. Ekert proposed a completely different type of quantum
key distribution protocol based on entanglement. In the chapter of
composite system, we learned that we can prepare a sequence of entangled
pairs of qubits like $\frac{\ket{00}+\ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}}$ or
$\frac{\ket{01}+\ket{10}}{\sqrt{2}}$. For the discussion convenience, we
assume the pair of entangled qubits in the state of
$\frac{\ket{00}+\ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}}$.

1.  (Alice and Bob)

    -   Both sides are each assigned one of each of the pairs of
        entangled qubits

2.  (Alice and Bob)

    -   separately choose a random sequence of bases

    -   measure their qubits in their chosen basis

    <img
    id="fig:EPR-step2"

    alt="EPR-step2"
    style={{ width: '60%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    />

3.  (Alice and Bob)

    -   publicly compare what bases were used

    -   keep only those bits measured in the same basis

    <img
    id="fig:EPR-step3"
    src={require('../static/img/EPR-step3.jpg').default}
    alt="EPR-step3"
    style={{ width: '60%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
    />

4.  (optional for intrusion or disentangled detection)

    -   Bob randomly chooses half of the n/2 bits

    -   Bob publicly compares them with Alice

## Quantum Teleportation

**Quantum teleportation** is the process by which the state of an
arbitrary qubit is transferred from one location to another.

**Canonical and non-canonical bases for a single qubit.** When working
with a single qubit, we worked with the canonical basis,
$\{\ket{0},\ket{1}\}$ï¼Œ and non-canonical basis,
$\{\frac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{\ket{0}-\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}\}$,
as shown in Figure
[6.15](#fig:canonical-non-canonical-bases).

<img
    id="fig:canonical-non-canonical-bases"
    src={require('../static/img/can.png').default}

    style={{ width: '80%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>
<figcaption style= {{textAlign: 'center', fontFamily: 'Calibri'}}>Figure 6.15: Canonical and non-canonical basis used in the quantum
teleportation.</figcaption>

**Canonical and non-canonical bases for two qubits.** The teleportation
algorithm will work with two entangled qubits, one held by Alice and one
held by Bob. The obvious canonical basis for this four-dimensional space
is: $$\{\ket{0_A 0_B}, \ket{0_A 1_B}, \ket{1_A 0_B}, \ket{1_A 1_b}\}$$ A
non-canonical basis, called the Bell basis in honor of John Bell,
consists of the following four vectors: $$\begin{aligned}
        \ket{\Psi^+}&=\frac{\ket{0_A 1_B}+\ket{1_A 0_B}}{\sqrt(2)},\quad
        \ket{\Psi^-}=\frac{\ket{0_A 1_B}-\ket{1_A 0_B}}{\sqrt(2)},\\
        \ket{\Phi^+}&=\frac{\ket{0_A 0_B}+\ket{1_A 1_B}}{\sqrt(2)},\quad
        \ket{\Phi^-}=\frac{\ket{0_A 0_B}-\ket{1_A 1_B}}{\sqrt(2)}
    \end{aligned}$$ Every vector in this basis is entangled.

**Bell circuit.** How to derive the Bell basis? In the single qubit
(two-dimensional) case, the elements of the noncanonical basis can be
formed using the Hadamard matrix:
$$\mathbf{H}\ket{0} = \frac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}\quad \textrm{and}\quad \mathbf{H}\ket{1} = \frac{\ket{0}-\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$$

In the two qubits (four-dimensional) case, the elements of the
non-canonical basis are derived from Bell circuit:

<img
    id="fig:Bell-circuit"
    src={require('../static/img/Bell-circuit.png').default}
    alt="Bell-circuit"
    style={{ width: '50%', height: 'auto', display: 'block', margin: '0 auto' }}
/>

From which, we have $\ket{00}\mapsto\ket{\Phi^+}$,
$\ket{10}\mapsto\ket{\Phi^-}$, $\ket{01}\mapsto\ket{\Psi^+}$,
$\ket{11}\mapsto\ket{\Psi^-}$.

:::info[example] 
example: $$\begin{aligned}
            \textrm{CNOT}\cdot(\mathbf{H}\ket{0}\otimes \ket{0})&=\textrm{CNOT}\cdot(\frac{\ket{0}+\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}\otimes \ket{0})\\&=
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
                0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
                0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
                0 & 0 & 0 & 1
            \end{bmatrix}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1\\0\\1\\0
            \end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
            \begin{bmatrix}
                1\\0\\0\\1
            \end{bmatrix}=\frac{\ket{00}+\ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}}=\ket{\Phi^+}
        \end{aligned}$$
:::

**Quantum teleportation protocol.** The whole protocol contains $5$
steps:

1.  : Alice has a qubit $\ket{\psi}=\alpha\ket{0}+\beta\ket{1}$.

2.  : prepare two entangled quibit A and B

    -   two entangled quibits are formed as $\ket{\Phi^+}$

    -   one is given to Alice and one is given to Bob

4.  : Alice makes a measurement

    -   Alice measures her two qubits

    -   Alice determines to which of the four possible states the system
        collapses

5.  : Bob performs the corresponding transformation based on Alice's
    observations

    -   Alice sends copies of her two bits (not qubits) to Bob

    -   Bob uses that information to achieve the desired state

Instructor </figcaption>
    

The whole framework of the quantum teleportation protocol is shown in
Figure [6.8](#fig:qt-framework). Several points should be made about this
protocol:

-   Alice is no longer in possession of $\ket{\psi}$. She has only two
    classical bits.

-   As we have seen, to "teleport" a single quantum particle, Alice has
    to send two classical bits. Without receiving them, there is no way
    that Bob can know what he has. These classical bits travel along a
    classical channel and thus they propagate at finite speed (less than
    the speed of light). Entanglement, in spite of its undisputable
    magic, does not allow you to communicate faster than the speed of
    light.

-   Information teleported from Alice to Bob via qubit is infinite, but
    it is useless to Bob once he make the measurement (qubit will
    collapse to a classic bit).

-   no particle has been moved at all, only the state.
